1. An 8-section narrative (500-700 words) in markdown format
2. Structured metadata for system use

Respond with a JSON object with these exact fields:
- projectName (string)
- buildingType (string: e.g. "Mixed-Use Tower", "Educational Campus", "Healthcare Facility")
- floors (number)
- totalArea (number, in square meters)
- structure (string: structural system description)
- facade (string: facade material/system description)
- sustainabilityFeatures (array of strings)
- programSummary (string: brief description of building program)
- estimatedCost (string: e.g. "£12.5M")
- constructionDuration (string: e.g. "18 months")
- narrative (string: full 8-section markdown description, see below)

NARRATIVE FORMAT (500-700 words):
Write a professional, client-facing architectural narrative with these 8 sections:

**Project Overview** (2-3 sentences)
Scale, location, and core architectural concept. E.g., "A [height]-story [typology] occupying [area] across [site]. Located in [context], the project responds to [site condition] with [strategy]."

**Spatial Organization**
Vertical/horizontal program distribution. Describe how the building is organized (podium + tower, zoning, floor-by-floor logic) and the functional benefits. Specific floor ranges and dimensions where relevant.

**Facade & Materiality**
Exterior expression: material systems, street-level treatment, distinctive elements. Be specific about materials (e.g., "unitized curtain wall with low-E glazing" not just "glass"). Describe how facade performs (light control, thermal, aesthetic).

**Urban Integration**
How building meets the street and context. Public realm strategy, pedestrian experience, relationship to adjacent buildings/infrastructure. Ground plane treatment, entries, circulation logic.

**Environmental Response**
Climate-specific passive/active strategies. Reference local climate conditions and how design responds (orientation, shading, ventilation, glazing specs, green features). Include sustainability metrics if applicable (energy reduction %, certifications).

**Interior Character**
Spatial quality and user experience. Floor plate dimensions, ceiling heights, key amenities. Describe what it feels like to be inside. Mention views, natural light, flexibility, distinctive spaces.

**Material Palette** (bullet list only)
- Structure: [system]
- Facade: [specific materials + finishes]
- Base: [ground level materials]
- Roof/Top: [crown/rooftop treatment]

**Project Impact**
Why this project matters. What benchmark it sets, who it serves, what it achieves (functional + symbolic). 1-2 sentences that tie everything together.

TERMINOLOGY GUIDELINES:
- Client-facing professional, not technical specs
- YES: "unitized curtain wall," "floor-to-floor heights," "thermal mass," "podium," "setbacks"
- NO: "BIM," "LOD 300," "HVAC zones," "structural grid coordinates"
- Specific > generic: "15-story" not "tall," "2.5m colonnade" not "covered area"
- Material specificity: "fair-faced concrete with board-formed texture" not just "concrete"

QUALITY STANDARD:
Should read like competition board text or architectural award submission. Evocative but precise. Spatial awareness. Context-responsive. Every sentence adds information. No generic fluff.

TARGET: 9/10 quality. Reference: architectural magazine features, design competition entries.`,
