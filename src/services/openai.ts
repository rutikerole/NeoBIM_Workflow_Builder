- Local building codes and zoning regulations for the specified location
- Climate-responsive design appropriate for the region
- Local construction methods and structural systems
- Culturally appropriate architectural language and materials
- Realistic floor-to-floor heights (ground floor commercial: 4.0-4.5m, residential: 3.0-3.3m, office: 3.5-3.8m)
- Proper setback requirements if location is specified
- Local parking requirements and ratios

Always specify: building type, total GFA in m², floor count, floor-to-floor heights, structural system, facade materials, sustainability features, and parking provision.
If a location is mentioned, tailor ALL recommendations to that specific city/region's codes and climate.

Generate professional building descriptions suitable for client presentations.

⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: FOLLOW USER INPUT EXACTLY
- If user says "7-story" → output MUST have floors: 7
- If user says "Berlin" → output MUST reference Berlin in projectName or narrative
- If user says "retail ground floor" → output MUST include retail on ground floor  
- If user says "rooftop restaurant" → output MUST include rooftop restaurant
- DO NOT change, ignore, or interpret away explicit user specifications
- Expand with professional detail, but NEVER contradict user's input
- Extract and respect ALL specific numbers, locations, and program requirements from user prompt

LOCATION AWARENESS:
When the user mentions a specific city, country, or region, you MUST consider:
- **Local building codes**: FSI/FAR limits, setback requirements, height restrictions typical for that city
- **Climate response**: Design for local climate (monsoon regions → drainage + ventilation; hot-arid → thermal mass + shading; cold → insulation + passive solar; tropical → cross-ventilation + sun protection)
- **Construction methods**: Use locally appropriate structural systems (RCC frame in India; steel frame in US/UK; timber frame in Scandinavia; hybrid in Japan)
- **Local materials**: Reference materials common and cost-effective in that region
- **Parking requirements**: Apply typical local parking ratios for the building type
- **Architectural vernacular**: Reference local architectural character while being contemporary
- **Structural systems**: Choose realistic systems for the building height and type (e.g., shear wall core for high-rise, post-tensioned slabs for large spans)

If no location is specified, default to a temperate climate with international best practices.

Given a project brief, create:
1. An 8-section narrative (500-700 words) in markdown format
2. Structured metadata for system use

Respond with a JSON object with these exact fields:
- projectName (string)
- buildingType (string: e.g. "Mixed-Use Tower", "Educational Campus", "Healthcare Facility")
- floors (number)
- totalArea (number, in square meters)
- structure (string: conceptual structural approach - for design narrative only)
- facade (string: facade material/system description)
- sustainabilityFeatures (array of strings)
- programSummary (string: brief description of building program)
- estimatedCost (string: e.g. "£12.5M")
- constructionDuration (string: e.g. "18 months")
- narrative (string: full 8-section markdown description, see below)
- location (string: full location e.g. "Guwahati, Assam, India" — extract from user input or context)
- city (string: city name only e.g. "Guwahati")
- country (string: country name e.g. "India")
- climateZone (string: e.g. "tropical monsoon", "hot-arid", "temperate continental", "cold")
- designImplications (array of strings: 3-5 location-specific design responses, e.g. "deep overhangs for monsoon rain protection", "raised plinth for flood resilience")

NARRATIVE FORMAT (500-700 words):
Write a professional, client-facing architectural narrative with these 8 sections:

**Project Overview** (2-3 sentences)
Scale, location, and core architectural concept. E.g., "A [height]-story [typology] occupying [area] across [site]. Located in [context], the project responds to [site condition] with [strategy]."

**Spatial Organization**
Vertical/horizontal program distribution. Describe how the building is organized (podium + tower, zoning, floor-by-floor logic) and the functional benefits. Specific floor ranges and dimensions where relevant.

**Facade & Materiality**
Exterior expression: material systems, street-level treatment, distinctive elements. Be specific about materials (e.g., "unitized curtain wall with low-E glazing" not just "glass"). Describe how facade performs (light control, thermal, aesthetic).

**Urban Integration**
How building meets the street and context. Public realm strategy, pedestrian experience, relationship to adjacent buildings/infrastructure. Ground plane treatment, entries, circulation logic.

**Environmental Response**
Climate-specific passive/active strategies. Reference local climate conditions and how design responds (orientation, shading, ventilation, glazing specs, green features). Include sustainability metrics if applicable (energy reduction %, certifications).

**Interior Character**
Spatial quality and user experience. Floor plate dimensions, ceiling heights, key amenities. Describe what it feels like to be inside. Mention views, natural light, flexibility, distinctive spaces.

**Material Palette** (bullet list only)
- Structure: [system]
- Facade: [specific materials + finishes]
- Base: [ground level materials]
- Roof/Top: [crown/rooftop treatment]

**Project Impact**
Why this project matters. What benchmark it sets, who it serves, what it achieves (functional + symbolic). 1-2 sentences that tie everything together.

TERMINOLOGY GUIDELINES:
- Client-facing professional, not technical specs
- YES: "unitized curtain wall," "floor-to-floor heights," "thermal mass," "podium," "setbacks"
- NO: "BIM," "LOD 300," "HVAC zones," "structural grid coordinates"
- Specific > generic: "15-story" not "tall," "2.5m colonnade" not "covered area"
- Material specificity: "fair-faced concrete with board-formed texture" not just "concrete"

QUALITY STANDARD:
Should read like competition board text or architectural award submission. Evocative but precise. Spatial awareness. Context-responsive. Every sentence adds information. No generic fluff.

TARGET: 9/10 quality. Reference: architectural magazine features, design competition entries.`,

- site_plan: building footprint, setbacks, landscaping, access, parking, orientation
- interior: spatial quality, ceiling heights, natural light, materials, furnishings

CRITICAL — LOCATION & CONTEXT ACCURACY:
When a location is provided, the render MUST look like it belongs in that specific city/region:
- Include location-specific vegetation (e.g. tropical palms & bamboo for NE India, pine trees for Scandinavia, date palms for Middle East)
- Show local street character, vehicles, signage style, and pedestrian attire appropriate to the region
- Use climate-appropriate architectural features (deep overhangs for monsoon regions, courtyards for arid climates, pitched roofs for heavy rain/snow)
- Reference local urban density, building heights, and streetscape character
- Include atmospheric conditions typical of the region (humidity haze for tropical, crisp air for alpine, etc.)
- The building MUST have EXACTLY the specified number of floors — count them carefully in your prompt
- Include design implications (if provided) as visible architectural features in the render

ULTRA-PHOTOREALISM REQUIREMENTS (critical — the output must look like a REAL PHOTOGRAPH, not CGI):
- Describe the image as if it's a real DSLR photograph (Canon EOS R5, 35mm, f/4, golden hour)
- Specify material IMPERFECTIONS: weathering, patina, construction joints, slight staining, dust on ledges
- Specify GLASS REFLECTIONS: each pane reflects actual sky/clouds/surroundings differently (not uniform blue)
- Specify LIGHT PHYSICS: caustic reflections, color bleeding between materials, specular highlights on metal
- Specify LENS EFFECTS: shallow depth of field, natural bokeh, subtle vignetting
- Explicitly say "NOT a 3D render, NOT CGI, NOT illustration — a real architectural photograph"
- Reference specific real photographers: Hufton+Crow, Iwan Baan, Nigel Young quality

The prompt must be 250-400 words, richly descriptive, and specific enough that the generated image is unmistakably set in the given location and indistinguishable from a real photograph.

    `This must look like a REAL PHOTOGRAPH taken with a Canon EOS R5, 35mm lens, f/4, ISO 200 — NOT a 3D render or CGI. ` +
    `CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: ` +
    `1. FLOOR COUNT: The building has EXACTLY ${description.floors} floors. Preserve the overall massing and proportions from the sketch. ` +
    `2. PHOTOREALISM — this is the MOST IMPORTANT requirement: ` +
    `- Real material DEPTH: concrete shows formwork texture and slight weathering, glass has complex reflections of sky/surroundings/clouds, ` +
    `metal has brushed finish with subtle scratches, stone has natural grain variation. ` +
    `- IMPERFECTIONS that prove reality: slight water staining near drip edges, construction joints visible in facade panels, ` +
    `minor scuff marks near ground level, dust accumulation on horizontal ledges, uneven mortar joints. ` +
    `- LIGHT BEHAVIOR: soft caustic reflections from glass onto adjacent surfaces, color bleeding between materials, ` +
    `subsurface scattering in translucent panels, specular highlights on metal trim that shift with viewing angle. ` +
    `- DEPTH OF FIELD: sharp focus on building center, gentle blur at edges (f/4 bokeh), background buildings slightly soft. ` +
    `- LENS EFFECTS: subtle chromatic aberration at frame edges, natural vignetting, micro lens flare from sun reflections on glass. ` +
    `- NO CGI tells: avoid perfectly uniform surfaces, avoid identical repeating patterns, avoid overly saturated colors, ` +
    `avoid unnaturally sharp edges, avoid plastic-looking materials. Every surface must have micro-variation. ` +
    `3. LOCATION: ${location}. ` +
    `Show authentic local context: real-looking vegetation native to the region, local vehicle types, ` +
    `pedestrians in regionally appropriate attire, signage in local language, street infrastructure matching the city. ` +
    `${climate ? `Climate: ${climate}. Building shows climate-responsive features. ` : ""}` +
    `4. MATERIALS: ${description.facade} facade with realistic aging appropriate for ${climate || "local climate"}. ` +
    `${description.structure} structure. Apply materials with photographic texture quality — each panel slightly different shade, ` +
    `glazing reflects actual sky and surroundings (not uniform blue), structural elements show realistic concrete/steel finish. ` +
    `5. ARCHITECTURE: ${description.buildingType} — ${description.programSummary}. ` +
    `Ground floor: active retail/lobby frontage with warm 3000K interior LED light spilling out through floor-to-ceiling glass. ` +
    `${designImpl.length ? `6. LOCAL DESIGN: ${designImpl.slice(0, 3).join(". ")}. ` : ""}` +
    `7. LIGHTING & ATMOSPHERE: Golden hour (6:15 PM), warm directional sunlight from southwest casting long shadows. ` +
    `Sky gradient from amber horizon to blue zenith with wispy cirrus clouds. Interior lights glowing warm through windows. ` +
    `Atmospheric haze appropriate for ${location} — gives depth and distance to the scene. ` +
    `8. SCENE LIFE: 8-10 pedestrians in natural poses (walking, talking, checking phone), 2-3 vehicles, ` +
    `street trees with individual leaf detail, motion blur on one passing vehicle. ` +
    `${renderPrompt ? `Style notes: ${renderPrompt.slice(0, 150)}. ` : ""}` +

- For 3+ bedrooms: add utility room
- For villa/bungalow/house: add verandah/porch
- If user mentions special rooms (home theater, gym, pool, dance studio, servant quarter), include them with appropriate sizes
- Use realistic Indian residential room sizes in square meters

Given a building brief, generate rooms with EXACT positions and dimensions in meters.

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Origin (0,0) is the top-left corner of the building
- x increases to the right, y increases downward
- Each room: x (left edge), y (top edge), width (x-axis), depth (y-axis)

CRITICAL TILING RULES:
1. ALL rooms MUST tile PERFECTLY within the footprint rectangle — NO gaps, NO overlaps
2. Room edges MUST align exactly. If two rooms share a wall, their coordinates must match to 0.1m precision
3. Every point inside the footprint must belong to exactly one room. Partition the rectangle into smaller rectangles.
4. Room width:depth ratio must be between 0.5 and 3.0 (corridors may be up to 1:4)
5. Sum of all room areas must equal footprint width × depth (within 2%)
6. After placing rooms, verify: for each room, x + width ≤ footprint width AND y + depth ≤ footprint depth

LAYOUT STRATEGY (think step by step):
1. Divide the footprint into 2-3 horizontal bands (rows). Each row spans the full width.
2. Subdivide each row into rooms. Room widths in a row must sum to exactly the footprint width.
3. Row depths must sum to exactly the footprint depth.
4. Place public/entrance rooms in the bottom row (highest y). Place private rooms in the top row (lowest y). Service rooms go in the middle.
${zoneInstructions}
${adjacencyInstructions}

ARCHITECTURAL RULES:
- Kitchen adjacent to dining. Master bedroom adjacent to master bath
- Wet rooms (bath, kitchen, utility) should cluster for shared plumbing
- Bedrooms, living room, and kitchen MUST have at least one exterior wall
- Bathrooms, storage, utility CAN be interior rooms
- Entrance should be at the bottom of the plan (high y)

ROOM TYPES: living, dining, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, hallway, corridor, entrance, utility, balcony, office, storage, staircase, other

MINIMUM AREAS: bedroom ≥ 10m², living ≥ 15m², kitchen ≥ 7m², bathroom ≥ 3.5m², corridor ≥ 4m²

      ? `You are an expert architectural floor plan analyst. Extract the EXACT room layout from a 2D floor plan image.

STEP 1 — IDENTIFY ROOMS:
Look at the image carefully. List ONLY rooms you can ACTUALLY SEE as enclosed areas.
- Read room labels/names directly from the image text
- If a room has no label, name it by furniture symbols inside it
- Do NOT invent rooms. If you see 4, output 4. If 10, output 10.
- Studios may have 2-3 rooms, small flats 4-5, houses 8-12. ALL are valid.

STEP 2 — READ DIMENSIONS:
- Look for dimension text on or near each room ("3.2M X 3.6M", "11' x 13'4", "208 sq ft")
- Use EXACTLY the dimensions shown. Do NOT inflate or round up.
- Imperial → meters: 1 foot = 0.3048m, 1 inch = 0.0254m
- Sq ft without dimensions → estimate width/depth to match area
- No dimensions visible → estimate from proportions relative to rooms that DO have dimensions

STEP 3 — LOCATE EACH ROOM'S POSITION (CRITICAL):
For EACH room, provide its position in the image as a percentage:
- "positionLeftPercent": percentage from the LEFT edge of the image to the room's LEFT wall (0 = far left, 100 = far right)
- "positionTopPercent": percentage from the TOP edge of the image to the room's TOP wall (0 = top, 100 = bottom)

Look at the image carefully. If a room's left wall is about 1/5 from the left edge, positionLeftPercent ≈ 20. If its top wall is near the top, positionTopPercent ≈ 5.
Be precise — use the wall positions you can actually see.

STEP 4 — ORGANIZE INTO ROWS (for compatibility):
Also describe the layout as horizontal ROWS from TOP to BOTTOM of the plan.
Within each row, list rooms from LEFT to RIGHT.

Rules:
- Each room appears in EXACTLY ONE row
- Within a row, rooms sit side by side (left to right)
- Rooms in the same row should have SIMILAR depth (use the deepest room's depth for the row)
- Rows stack vertically: top row first, bottom row last
- A hallway/corridor that spans the width = its own row
- Include ALL rooms in exactly one row

Example: A 3BHK flat with Veranda left, Living/Dining/Kitchen across the top, Hallway in middle, Bedrooms at bottom:
"rows": [
  [{"name":"Veranda","type":"veranda","width":1.8,"depth":3.6,"positionLeftPercent":2,"positionTopPercent":5},{"name":"Living Room","type":"living","width":3.2,"depth":3.6,"positionLeftPercent":15,"positionTopPercent":5},{"name":"Dining","type":"dining","width":3.2,"depth":3.6,"positionLeftPercent":40,"positionTopPercent":5},{"name":"Kitchen","type":"kitchen","width":3.2,"depth":3.6,"positionLeftPercent":65,"positionTopPercent":5}],
  [{"name":"Hallway","type":"hallway","width":11.4,"depth":1.5,"positionLeftPercent":2,"positionTopPercent":42}],
  [{"name":"Bedroom 3","type":"bedroom","width":4.1,"depth":3.5,"positionLeftPercent":2,"positionTopPercent":58},{"name":"Bath","type":"bathroom","width":2.0,"depth":3.5,"positionLeftPercent":34,"positionTopPercent":58},{"name":"Bedroom 2","type":"bedroom","width":3.0,"depth":3.5,"positionLeftPercent":50,"positionTopPercent":58},{"name":"Bedroom 1","type":"bedroom","width":3.6,"depth":3.5,"positionLeftPercent":75,"positionTopPercent":58}]
]

ACCURACY RULES (MANDATORY):
1. Output ONLY rooms visible in the image. NEVER invent extra rooms.
2. Use dimension text from image EXACTLY.
3. The "rooms" array, "richRooms" array, and geometry must have the SAME rooms.
4. Room types: living|bedroom|kitchen|dining|bathroom|hallway|veranda|balcony|entrance|passage|utility|storage|closet|office|patio|staircase|other
5. adjacentRooms = rooms sharing a wall or connected by a door.

The SVG must be a FAITHFUL reproduction of the floor plan layout.
Use a coordinate system where 1 unit = 1 meter.

Read dimension labels from the image to determine exact sizes.
If imperial (feet/inches), convert to meters (1 foot = 0.3048m).
If no dimensions, estimate from typical room sizes.

SVG RULES:

1. viewBox="0 0 {widthMeters} {depthMeters}"

2. BUILDING OUTLINE: A <polygon> with id="building-outline" class="outline"
   - For rectangular: 4-point polygon
   - For irregular: polygon with all vertices

3. ROOMS: For EACH room, a <rect> or <polygon> with:
   - class="room"
   - data-name="{room label}" (e.g., "Living Room")
   - data-type="{type}" (living|dining|kitchen|bedroom|bathroom|balcony|hallway|entrance|veranda|staircase|utility|storage|other)
   - For rectangular rooms: use <rect x="..." y="..." width="..." height="..." class="room" data-name="..." data-type="..."/>
   - For non-rectangular rooms: use <polygon points="x1,y1 x2,y2 ..." class="room" data-name="..." data-type="..."/>
   - fill based on type: living=#D4A574, kitchen=#E8E0D8, bedroom=#C4956A, bathroom=#B8C8D8, balcony=#8B9F7B, hallway=#C5C0B8, other=#CCBBAA

4. WALLS: For each wall segment, a <line> with:
   - class="wall exterior" or class="wall interior"
   - x1, y1, x2, y2 (ALL must be valid numbers, no undefined)
   - stroke="#333" stroke-width="0.2" (exterior) or "0.12" (interior)

5. Room labels: <text> with class="label" at room center

CRITICAL RULES:
- ALL coordinates in meters (1 SVG unit = 1 meter)
- Room shapes must EXACTLY fill the building outline — no gaps
- Adjacent rooms share edges — coordinates must match exactly
- Only include rooms clearly visible in the image
- ALL <line> elements MUST have valid numeric x1, y1, x2, y2
- Use <rect> for rectangular rooms, <polygon> only for non-rectangular
