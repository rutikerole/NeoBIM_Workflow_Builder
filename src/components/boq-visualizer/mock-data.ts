    summary: `This Bill of Quantities covers a Commercial Complex of ₹8.1 Cr total project cost spread across 2,284 m² gross floor area in Bhilai, Chhattisgarh. The estimated cost per m² of ₹35,464 falls within the expected benchmark range of ₹28,000–₹42,000 for Tier-2 commercial construction.\n\nStructural works form the largest cost component at approximately 45% of hard costs, driven by RCC foundations (₹28.5 L), columns (₹17.2 L), beams (₹36.4 L), and slabs (₹52.1 L). Steel reinforcement at 48,000 kg of Fe500D rebar represents ₹45.4 L at current SAIL Bhilai rates of ₹72,000/tonne.\n\nMEP provisional sums total ₹1.65 Cr (approximately 20% of project cost), with HVAC being the dominant component at ₹54 L. These are benchmark-based estimates and should be validated with detailed MEP design.\n\nThe IFC model quality score of 78% (GOOD) provides reasonable confidence in geometric quantities. 3 anomalies were detected including missing storey assignments and slab thickness inconsistencies that should be reviewed.`,

    disclaimer: "This is an AI-generated cost estimate prepared using IS 1200 / CPWD DSR 2023-24 rates with regional adjustments for Bhilai, Chhattisgarh. All quantities are derived from IFC model geometry where available, supplemented by benchmark rates for provisional items. This estimate is suitable for preliminary budgeting (AACE Class 3) and should not be used for tendering without detailed measurement verification. Market prices are indicative and subject to change.",
